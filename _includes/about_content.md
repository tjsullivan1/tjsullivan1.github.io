## Me

I am an IT Pro. For the past few years, I had a heavy emphasis on Windows System Administration, PowerShell Automation, Active Directory Administration, and Identity Management. I am brushing up on my Linux and starting to take the leap into the cloud. I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate. For more of my history, check out my [curriculum vitae]({{site.url}}/cv.html).

On the personal side, I enjoy woodworking, cooking, reading, and personal finance.

## The Blog

I am an ops guy working on my automation, cloud, and programming skills. This blog will serve as a document repository as well as an explanation of the things that I am currently learning (Infrastructure as Code, AWS, Infrastructure Automation, Python).

## Projects

Here I will include links to series of posts that make up larger projects (some posts might just be about a particular technique, and some projects may span multiple scripts and multiple posts.)

## Disclaimer

All opinions are my own. No discussion of any organization or technology service provider should be interpreted as their endorsement of me or my services unless otherwise stated. I got the formatting for this blog from the Udemy course, [Create Jekyll blog and host it on Github like a Ninja](https://www.udemy.com/create-free-jekyll-blog-on-github-pages-like-a-ninja/learn/v4/overview)
